Support Vector Classification

Support Vector Classification(SVC) is a supervised learning algorithm used for classification. It is widely popular for its performance and efficiency in Machine Learning and is a class of Support Vector Machines. Support Vector Classifiers are linear as well as non-probabilistic. SVM also supports the kernel method called kernel SVM which allows us to tackle non-linearity.

Understanding The Basics Of SVM With Example And Python Implementation
In this practise session, we will learn to code SVM Classifier. We will perform the following steps to build a simple classifier using the popular Iris dataset. You can find the dataset here.

Step 1. Data Preprocessing 

Importing the libraries.
Importing dataset (Dataset Link https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/iris).
Dealing with the categorical variable.
Classifying dependent and independent variables.
Splitting the data into a training set and test set.
Feature scaling.
Step 2. SVM Classification 

Create a Support Vector classifier.
Feed the training data to the classifier.
Predicting the species for the test set.
Using the confusion matrix to find accuracy.
